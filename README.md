# Supervised_ML_House_prices

"Tell me about your dream house and I'll tell you what it costs." üè†

In this **Supervised Machine Learning** project I analyze a dataset of housing data and train machine learning algorithms to predict house prices. 
It is a regression approach, meaning that the predicted labels (house prices) are on a continuous scale.

This is a learning project, in which I practice machine learning techniques such as feature selection, 
grid search with cross validation and pipelines consisting of preprocessing and modeling steps. 
I test a variety of models with different architectures to find the best performing ones.

I use the best model to submit a prediction to the associated [indefinitely running Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Content
The project is separated into 4 working notebooks:
- *01: Data Preparation and Exploration*
- *02: Baseline Model*
- *03: Feature Selection*
- *04: Model Training and Selection*

## Dataset
The dataset originates from the challenge's website and can be downloaded from the "Data" tab. 
A detailed description of the features can be found at the end of this notebook 
and stems from the `data_description.txt` file from Kaggle.

## Context
This Machine Learning project was carried out in the context of a 4.5 month-long Data Science bootcamp with WBS Coding School. 
Many thanks to WBS Coding School and to my instructors for the guidance.
